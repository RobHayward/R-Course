{"name":"R-course","tagline":"This is the repo for the R Course Materials","body":"### R Course\r\n\r\nThis is introduction to R and to statistical programming.  \r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nR is an open-source statistical programming language.  It is available from the following website: [R-Cran](http://www.r-project.org/). You should install R on you labtop.  For us it is probably best to use the [following link](http://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/).  You can also install [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. \r\n\r\n## Competitors\r\nR is one of the main programmable statistical languages.  Others include:\r\n* Stata:  Use in academic econometrics. This is not open source.\r\n* Matlab:  Used extensively in academic finance.  It is not open-source.  \r\nThere is an open-source clone called *Octave*.  It can be downloaded \r\n[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)\r\n* Python: Computer Language for statistical programming.  \r\n* Julia:  New language that is faster than R\r\n* C++:  Programming language.  Underneath R is C++ in some cases. \r\n\r\n## Advantages of using R\r\nThe main advantages of using an open-source statistical programming language \r\nlike R are:\r\n* It can be used by anyone for no cost.  Your model will not depend on the \r\nnext institution having the same software licence\r\n* Programming language will encourage *reproducible research*\r\n\r\n## Reproducible Research\r\nReproducible Research means that results can be easily replicated.  This means\r\n* Mistakes are less likely to happen than would be the case with *copy and \r\n   paste*\r\n* Mistakes can be more swiftly identified\r\n* Changes to data or research methods are easier to make\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nA famous case where Exel failed. \r\n* [LSE commentary on Reinhart and Rogoff](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/10/23/open-data-in-economics-the-basis-of-reproducible-research/)\r\n\r\n## R Course\r\n[First R Lesson](http://rpubs.com/RobHayward/Course)\r\n[Quantmod Examples](http://rpubs.com/RobHayward/R2)","google":"Rob","note":"Don't delete this file!
