Others include:\r\n* Stata:  Use in academic econometrics. This is not open source.\r\n* Matlab:  Used extensively in academic finance.  It is not open-source.  \r\nThere is an open-source clone called *Octave*.  It can be downloaded \r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\r\n* Python: Computer Language for statistical programming.  \r\n* Julia:  New language that is faster than R\r\n* C++:  Programming language.  Underneath R is C++ in some cases. \r\n\r\nAdvantages of using R\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe main advantages of using an open-source statistical programming language \r\nlike R are:\r\n* It can be used by anyone for no cost.  Your model will not depend on the \r\nnext institution having the same software licence\r\n* Programming language will encourage *reproducible research*\r\n\r\nReproducible Research\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nReproducible Research means that results can be easily replicated.  This means\r\n* Mistakes are less likely to happen than would be the case with *copy and \r\n   paste*\r\n* Mistakes can be more swiftly identified\r\n* Changes to data or research methods are easier to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"Rob","note":"Don't delete this file!
