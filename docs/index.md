Introduction
========================================================
R is an open-source statistical programming language.  It is available from the following website: [R-Cran](http://www.r-project.org/). You should install R on you laptop.  For us it is probably best to use the [following link](http://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/).  You can also install [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. 

Competitors
----------------------------------------------------------
R is one of the main programmable statistical languages.  Others include:
* Stata:  Used in academic econometrics. This is not open source.
* Matlab:  Used extensively in academic finance.  It is not open-source.  There is an open-source clone called *Octave*.  It can be downloaded [here.](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
* Python: Computer Langue for statistical programming.  This is a good alternative to R. 
* C++:  Programming language.  Underneath R is C++ in some cases. 

Advantages of using R
------------------------------------------------------------
The main advantages of using an open-source statistical programming language like R are:
* It can be used by anyone for no cost.  
* You can read and adjust functions that have been created by other people
* There is a large community of people to help you
* Your model will not depend on the next institution having the same software licence (do firms use Eviews?)
* Programming language will encourage *reproducible research*

Reproducible Research
--------------------------------------------------------------
Reproducible Research is good practice and it means that results can be easily replicated.  This means
* Mistakes are less likely to happen than would be the case with *copy and paste*
* Someone else can easily see what you have done (that *someone* could be your future self trying to re-solve a similar problem)
* Mistakes can be more swiftly identified
* Changes to data or research methods are easier to make
* Replication and clarity are increasingly important for compliance in financial institutions
