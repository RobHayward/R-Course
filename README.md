This is the repo for the R Course Materials

The `Introduction.Rmd` file in the `Knitr` directory.  This provides an overview and some links to get resources such as *Cran* and *Posit*.   Then the following resources have been used for EC404: 

- **First.R** is the introduction to basic operations with some short items on objects, data frames and basic plotting.   There is also an overview of `rnorm`, `drnorm`, `qnorm` and `pnorm`.   

- **Firmperformance.R** repeats our excel exercise in R.  After downloading data into a csv file, we will import, calculate key variables and plot.  

- **QuantmodExamples.Rmd** provides an introduction to packages and showcases the quantmod package, included automatic downloading of data form `Yahoo Finance ` and the `St. Louis Fed database`.
