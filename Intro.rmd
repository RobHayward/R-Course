Competitors
----------------------------------------------------------
R is one of the main programmable statistical languages.  Others include:
* Stata:  Use in academic econometrics. This is not open source.
* Matlab:  Used extensively in academic finance.  It is not open-source.  There is n open-source clone called *Octave*.  It can be downloaded [here.](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
* Python: Computer Languge for statistical programming.  
* Julia:  New languge that is faster than R
* C++:  Progrmming languge.  Underneath R is C++ in some cases. 

Advantages of using R
------------------------------------------------------------
The main advantges of using an open-source statistical programming languge like R are:
* It can be used by anyone for no cost.  Your model will not depend on the next institution having the same software licence
* Progrmming languge will encourage *reproducible research*

Reproducible Research
--------------------------------------------------------------
Reproducible Research means that results can be easily replicated.  This means
* Mistakes are less likely to happen thaj would be the case with *copy and paste*
* Mistakes can be more swiftly identified
* Changes to data or research methods are easier to make
